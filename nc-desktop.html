        <h2>about</h2>
        <article>Nikolay Cranner is a fantastic talent hailing from Norway with a strong impact and 
            artistic identity in the House genre. He developed a strong interest for house music over 
            the years and felt he could use a way to express his musical ideas.
            Before producing he actively played the piano, trumpet and later saxophone.
            His productions (so far) explore deep/minimal, jazzy and funky styles.
            
            “Darkest Love” is a mind-blowing deep house production. 
            The composition consists of melodic deep vocals by Kieran Fowkes, minted with a mid-range spacious lead. 
            The song is dominated by the sub-frequency domain and intertwined with harmonic chord progression, sparky synths and mysterious pads.
            
            In March 2020 he made his debut on Spanish imprint Cientoonce in Valencia with “Moving On EP”.
            It shows off a classy and wistful flurry of deep and blissed out chords and keys from Nikolay’s 
            crafty fingertips and a tasty rework from Victor Polo which leans more into the dancefloor fundamentals. 
            
            Late 2019 he gave out a stunning vocal house production titled “Lies”. 
            This release sets the bar higher in terms of punch and attitude, 
            making for a unique flow in terms of rhythm, and melody. 
            The saxophone lead by Nikolay himself is organic and present, 
            cutting through the mix and giving it a jazzy vibe. 
            It also features French DJ/Producer "Siks" futuristic vocals performed by singer and songwriter “Eddie Jonsson”.
            
            He made his official debut on Trax Records in 2018, with "Dancin' EP".
